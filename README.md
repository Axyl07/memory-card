# 🔫 Memorry - Gun Memory Click Game

**Memorry** is a memory-based browser game where your goal is simple:
**Click every gun exactly once without repeating any selection.**

Each successful click earns you a point — but click a gun you've already chosen, and it’s **game over**.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

* A set of gun images is displayed on screen.
* Each time you click a gun:

  * ✅ If you haven’t clicked it before, your score increases.
  * ❌ If you click a gun you've already clicked, the game resets.
* After each valid click, the guns **shuffle randomly** to challenge your memory.
